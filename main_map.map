Design Summary
--------------

Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    0
Logic Utilization:
  Total Number Slice Registers:         598 out of   1,920   31%
    Number used as Flip Flops:          564
    Number used as Latches:              34
  Number of 4 input LUTs:               524 out of   1,920   27%
Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:            536 out of     960   55%
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:     536 out of     536 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of     536   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.
  Total Number of 4 input LUTs:         859 out of   1,920   44%
    Number used as logic:               492
    Number used as a route-thru:        335
    Number used as Shift registers:      32

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

  Number of bonded IOBs:                 54 out of     108   50%
  Number of RAMB16s:                      1 out of       4   25%
  Number of BUFGMUXs:                     4 out of      24   16%
  Number of DCMs:                         1 out of       2   50%

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                3.04

Peak Memory Usage:  315 MB
Total REAL time to MAP completion:  13 secs 
Total CPU time to MAP completion:   12 secs
