Design Summary
--------------

Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    0
Logic Utilization:
  Total Number Slice Registers:         565 out of   1,920   29%
    Number used as Flip Flops:          531
    Number used as Latches:              34
  Number of 4 input LUTs:               509 out of   1,920   26%
Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:            515 out of     960   53%
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:     515 out of     515 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of     515   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.
  Total Number of 4 input LUTs:         813 out of   1,920   42%
    Number used as logic:               477
    Number used as a route-thru:        304
    Number used as Shift registers:      32

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

  Number of bonded IOBs:                 55 out of     108   50%
  Number of RAMB16s:                      1 out of       4   25%
  Number of BUFGMUXs:                     4 out of      24   16%
  Number of DCMs:                         1 out of       2   50%

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                3.08

Peak Memory Usage:  314 MB
