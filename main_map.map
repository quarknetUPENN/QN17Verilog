WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net ila_control<13> is sourced
   by a combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to
   control the loading of data into the flip-flop.

Design Summary
--------------

Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    1
Logic Utilization:
  Total Number Slice Registers:       1,174 out of   1,920   61%
    Number used as Flip Flops:        1,140
    Number used as Latches:              34
  Number of 4 input LUTs:             1,665 out of   1,920   86%
Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:            949 out of     960   98%
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:     949 out of     949 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of     949   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.
  Total Number of 4 input LUTs:       1,805 out of   1,920   94%
    Number used as logic:             1,534
    Number used as a route-thru:        140
    Number used as Shift registers:     131

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

  Number of bonded IOBs:                 55 out of     108   50%
  Number of RAMB16s:                      4 out of       4  100%
  Number of BUFGMUXs:                     6 out of      24   25%
  Number of DCMs:                         1 out of       2   50%
  Number of BSCANs:                       1 out of       1  100%

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                3.41
