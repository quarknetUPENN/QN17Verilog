WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net ila_control<13> is sourced
   by a combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to
   control the loading of data into the flip-flop.

Design Summary

Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    2
Logic Utilization:
  Total Number Slice Registers:         942 out of   1,920   49%
    Number used as Flip Flops:          907
    Number used as Latches:              35
  Number of 4 input LUTs:               714 out of   1,920   37%
Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:            749 out of     960   78%
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:     749 out of     749 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of     749   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.
  Total Number of 4 input LUTs:       1,077 out of   1,920   56%
    Number used as logic:               551
    Number used as a route-thru:        363
    Number used as Shift registers:     163

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

  Number of bonded IOBs:                 55 out of     108   50%
  Number of RAMB16s:                      4 out of       4  100%
  Number of BUFGMUXs:                     5 out of      24   20%
  Number of DCMs:                         1 out of       2   50%
  Number of BSCANs:                       1 out of       1  100%

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                2.91
