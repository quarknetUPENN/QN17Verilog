WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net ila_control<13> is sourced by a combinatorial pin. This is not good
   design practice. Use the CE pin to control the loading of data into the flip-flop.

Design Summary
--------------

Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    1
Logic Utilization:
  Total Number Slice Registers:         816 out of   1,920   42%
    Number used as Flip Flops:          814
    Number used as Latches:               2
  Number of 4 input LUTs:               549 out of   1,920   28%
Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:            634 out of     960   66%
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:     634 out of     634 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of     634   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.
  Total Number of 4 input LUTs:         694 out of   1,920   36%
    Number used as logic:               458
    Number used as a route-thru:        145
    Number used as Shift registers:      91

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

  Number of bonded IOBs:                 55 out of     108   50%
    IOB Latches:                         32
  Number of RAMB16s:                      3 out of       4   75%
  Number of BUFGMUXs:                     6 out of      24   25%
  Number of DCMs:                         1 out of       2   50%
  Number of BSCANs:                       1 out of       1  100%

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                2.67
