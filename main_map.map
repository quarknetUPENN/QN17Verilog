WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net ila_control<13> is sourced
   by a combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to
   control the loading of data into the flip-flop.

Design Summary
--------------

Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    1
Logic Utilization:
  Total Number Slice Registers:         917 out of   1,920   47%
    Number used as Flip Flops:          883
    Number used as Latches:              34
  Number of 4 input LUTs:               690 out of   1,920   35%
Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:            732 out of     960   76%
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:     732 out of     732 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of     732   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.
  Total Number of 4 input LUTs:       1,054 out of   1,920   54%
    Number used as logic:               559
    Number used as a route-thru:        364
    Number used as Shift registers:     131

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

  Number of bonded IOBs:                 55 out of     108   50%
  Number of RAMB16s:                      4 out of       4  100%
  Number of BUFGMUXs:                     5 out of      24   20%
  Number of DCMs:                         1 out of       2   50%
  Number of BSCANs:                       1 out of       1  100%

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                2.93
